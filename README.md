# Wit Weather

Wit Weather is a responsive web application built with React and TypeScript that allows users to input a city name and view its weather forecast. It provides current weather information, hourly forecasts, a chart displaying weather variations throughout the day, and a 5-day weather forecast. Users can also switch between English and Portuguese languages and toggle between Celsius (ºC) and Fahrenheit (ºF) units. The weather information is retrieved from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/) using Axios. All styling is done using Tailwind CSS.
